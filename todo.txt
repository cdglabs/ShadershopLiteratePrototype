Priorities
  Direct manipulate variables
  Use custom fn's






Variable
  hovered variable
  right click menu
    unsync
    change domain

CustomFn
  Add new custom fn

RootExpr
  reorder by moving top variable?
  need a way to remove them too


Plot
  Spread variable
  Maybe show axes/grid on thumbnail plots
  Hover thumbnail plots
  Show params on thumbnail plots
  Show number values on top of plot
  Direct manipulate variables
  Snap pan/zoom


Autocomplete with search lookup


Use custom fn
  Put them in autocomplete
  Compile/evaluate correctly



Evaluation
  Fix issue with sqrt not drawing correctly in undefined areas
  Divide by zero check for discontinuities


Cleanup
  Get rid of lookup calls and do explicit passing?
  Reordering applications could use more cleanup
  Will need to cleanup variable domain/range stuff when generalizing to more than R1 -> R1
  Still some awkwardness with transclusion trees where a variable will "snap" into its parent ExprNodeView
  Move ExprNodeView reordering logic to ExprTreeView


Optimization
  Make plots cache appropriately
