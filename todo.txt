  Transclude
  hovered variable

CustomFn
  Add new custom fn

  "pull out" transclude from bottom left
  reorder by moving top variable?
  need a way to remove them too

  Scroll wheel zoom

  Maybe show axes/grid on thumbnail plots
  Show number values on top of plot
  Direct manipulate variables
  Snap pan/zoom



Evaluation
  Fix issue with sqrt not drawing correctly in undefined areas


Cleanup
  Get rid of lookup calls and do explicit passing?
  Reordering applications could use more cleanup
  Will need to cleanup variable domain/range stuff when generalizing to more than R1 -> R1


Optimization
  Make plots cache appropriately
