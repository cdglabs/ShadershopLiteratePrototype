Evaluation
  Fix issue with sqrt not drawing correctly in undefined areas
  Divide by zero check for discontinuities


Cleanup
  Get rid of lookup calls and do explicit passing?
  Reordering applications could use more cleanup
  Will need to cleanup variable domain/range stuff when generalizing to more than R1 -> R1
  Unify startTransclude on VariableLabel and TranscludeLinkIndicator


Need to check
  No removing an application that is transcluded
  No removing a RootExpr that has a transcluded application
  No moving an application so that a cycle is created
